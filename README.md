## Projects worth checking out
  * [Radio CLI](https://github.com/margual56/radio-cli):
     * A customizable Radio for your console made in Rust that uses mpv to play radios all around the world.
     * It can even play youtube videos and just download the audio (thanks to mpv)!
  * [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/margual56/tic-tac-toe):
     * A Rusty multiplayer implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.
     * It compiles to a single binary that contains a server and a client.
     * Two players can join over internet and play any size of board!
  * [Turing machine](https://github.com/margual56/TuringMachine):
     * A programmable, simplified, ideal [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) made in Java using [Processing](https://processing.org/)'s core utils
     * You can give it a program (following the syntax from [the examples](https://github.com/margual56/TuringMachine/blob/cafda932f13996d2a9adf20c2c7b9f5d74e655d5/Examples/Example1.tm)) and it will run it as if it had infinite memory on the tape.
     * Its interpreter supports Syntax and Runtime Errors
     * Add the [VsCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarcosGutirrezAlonso.turing-machine) or the [Code-OSS](https://open-vsx.org/extension/MarcosGutirrezAlonso/turing-machine) extensions to enable syntax highlighting of the code and more.
  * [Markdown renderer](https://github.com/margual56/Markdown-CLI):
      * It is incomplete, but it mostly works for 90% of the simpler markdown syntax
      * Lets you convert a simple markdown file into an HTML file, with the option to embed a stylesheet other than the default
