## List of my live pages:
  * [Pong game](https://margual56.github.io/pong) (mostly for PC users)
  * A [sudoku puzzle generator](https://margual56.github.io/sudoku-generator) (sometimes it crashes)
  * [My CV](https://margual56.github.io/mycv) (made using React... yeah ðŸ˜…)

## Projects worth checking out
  * [Turing machine](https://github.com/margual56/TuringMachine):
     * A programmable, simplified, ideal [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) made in Java using [Processing](https://processing.org/)'s core utils
     * You can give it a program (following the syntax from [the examples](https://github.com/margual56/TuringMachine/blob/cafda932f13996d2a9adf20c2c7b9f5d74e655d5/Examples/Example1.tm)) and it will run it as if it had infinite memory on the tape.
     * You can pause/unpause and restart the machine by pressing the spacebar
    
  * [Ray Marching](https://github.com/margual56/RayMarching):
      * A single-threaded, CPU-based, [Ray Marching](https://michaelwalczyk.com/blog-ray-marching.html) 3D renderer
      * So why is this special? Because it does not use triangles to define the meshes, but mathematical formulas. This means that every element of the render could theoretically (given infinite computational power) be rendered with infinite resolution.
      * Also it is made in java (and very badly because it was made in a week)
  
  * [Grep (clone)](https://github.com/margual56/grep-clone):
      * A simpler, slower and rustier version of grep
      * It is just a naive approach to string searching in a text... but it is written in Rust!
      * Also, [the wiki](https://github.com/margual56/grep-clone/wiki/Why-slower%3F) has a pretty cool analysis of GNU's grep vs my grep clone

  * [Markdown renderer](https://github.com/margual56/Markdown-CLI):
      * It is incomplete, but it mostly works for 90% of the simpler markdown syntax
      * Lets you convert a simple markdown file into an HTML file, with the option to embed a stylesheet other than the default
